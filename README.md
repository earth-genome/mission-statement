## Overview News

This repository contains materials that specify exactly what we're trying to do with Overview News. The primary resource is the [Design Iteration Form (DIF)](https://github.com/earth-genome/mission-statement/blob/master/DIF.md), following the framework from Kevin Starr at the Mulago Foundation and the Fitzroy Academy. The original document is [here](https://goo.gl/wVC32a).  The video series is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOmNc6rTseM&list=PLTYTquYYeup_zPlcRP5TgyBWStH9xLlvN).

Another document in this repository is a statement of how this project relates to the broader Earth Genome mission, team, and strategy.
